        <p>A new and seemingly more impressive artificial intelligence (AI) tool is released almost weekly, and researchers are flocking to try them out. Whether they are looking to edit manuscripts, write code or generate hypotheses, researchers have more generative AI tools to choose from than ever before.</p>

        <p>Each large language model (LLM) is suited to different tasks. Some are available through free chatbots, whereas others use a paid-for application programming interface (API) that means they can be integrated with other software. A few can also be downloaded, allowing researchers to build their own custom models.</p>

        <p>Although LLMs produce human-like responses, they all remain too error-prone to be used on their own, says Carrie Wright, a data scientist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center, headquartered in Seattle, Washington.</p>

        <h2>o3-mini (the reasoner)</h2>
        <p>OpenAI introduced the world to LLMs in 2022 with ChatGPT. Newer models like o3-mini, a speedy reasoner, excel at technical tasks such as solving coding issues and reformatting data, thanks to their step-by-step “chain of thought” process.</p>

        <h2>DeepSeek (the all-rounder)</h2>
        <p>DeepSeek-R1, launched in January 2025, rivals OpenAI’s o1 at a lower cost. It’s open-weight, allowing customization, and shines in math, coding, and hypothesis generation, though it’s slower and has security concerns.</p>

        <h2>Llama (the workhorse)</h2>
        <p>Llama, from Meta AI, is a widely-used open-weight model. It’s ideal for secure, proprietary data research and has been adapted for tasks like predicting crystal structures and simulating quantum computing.</p>

        <h2>Claude (the coder)</h2>
        <p>Claude 3.5 Sonnet, by Anthropic, is praised for coding and interpreting visuals. It retains technical meaning in writing, making it great for grant proposals and code annotations.</p>

        <h2>Olmo (the really open one)</h2>
        <p>OLMo 2 is fully open-source, offering transparency into training data and code. It’s ideal for studying bias and improving efficiency, though it requires some expertise to use.</p>
